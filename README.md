# stacks-decentralized-lottery
A permissionless, on‑chain lottery protocol built for the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. Players purchase numbered NFT tickets with STX, and every configurable interval a pseudo‑random draw selects winners and automatically distributes 90% of the accumulated pool to them, while 10% is reserved as protocol fees.
